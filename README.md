# Deon Roos' CV

This repo contains the code and data used to generate my CV using rmarkdown. I will occasionally update the data, but the .pdf document will may not be up to date.

The repo contains:

* `fonts` folder - folder that contains fonts.

* DeonRoos_CV.Rmd - rmarkdown file that pulls in data and outputs to .pdf

* DeonRoos_CV.Proj - project file

* DeonRoos_CV.pdf - the most recent version of the CV

* DeonRoos_CV_data.R - the R file which contains the data that is sourced into .Rmd

* README.md - this file used to create this readme

* awesome-cv.cls - file added by the `vitae` package
